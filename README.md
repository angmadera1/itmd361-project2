# itmd361-project
This is my submission for ITMD-361 final project part 2.

There are three different pages for this project:
1) "Homepage" consists of my most up-to-date resume, including information like relevant industry experience, education, projects, etc.
2) "Holland Lops for Sale" is a made-up rabbitry web page that sells Holland Lop rabbits.
3) "Learn About Floriography" consists of excerpt text and images from the book "Floriography: An Illustrated Guide to the Victorian Language of Flowers" written and illustrated by Jessica Roux.
