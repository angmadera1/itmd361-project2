        <h2 class="floriography-subheader">Why learn about Floriography?</h2>
        <p>The Victorian language of flowers—also called floriography—emerged as a clandestine method of communication at
          a time when proper etiquette discouraged open and flagrant displays of emotion. First emerging in 1819 with Charlotte
          de la Tour’s Le langage des fleurs, this coded “language” was used widely throughout the nineteenth century in both
          England and America and today is synonymous with Victorian tradition and culture. Flower meanings were taken from
          literature, mythology, religion, medieval legend, and even the shapes of the blooms themselves. Often, florists would invent
          symbolism to accompany new additions to their inventory, and occasionally, flowers had different meanings
          depending on the location and time. Young women of high society in this era embraced the practice, sending bouquets as
          tokens of love or warning, wearing flowers in their hair or tucked into their gowns, and celebrating all things floral.
          Many of them created small arrangements of flowers, called tussie-mussies or nosegays, by combining a few blooms
          in a small bouquet. Worn or carried as accessories, these coded messages of affection, desire, or sorrow allowed
          Victorians to show their true feelings in an enigmatic and alluring display.</p>
        <p>As the era came to an end and the First World War began, the language of flowers faded in popularity. Traces of
          the tradition remain, however. We still use roses to convey love at weddings and on Valentine’s Day, lilies for
          peace, and mums for condolences. The elegance and beauty of flowers have not dwindled—only our knowledge of
          their coded meanings. </p>
        <p>I hope this website, apart from offering a view into the history of floriography, will encourage readers to
          look at
          flowers and herbs in a new way, perhaps assigning their own meanings to the blooms that inspire them most.</p>

          <h3>Amaryllis</h3>
          <p><em>Hippeastrum</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Pride</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>The Victorians associated amaryllis with pride by virtue of its grand, tall stalks
            topped
            with bright blooms that towered over other flowers. Amaryllis, with its often leafless stems, is also known
            for
            withstanding drought. It is a strong and hearty plant, too prideful to perish under harsh conditions.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Hydrangea to indicate boastful pride Clematis to show the recipient should be
            proud
            of their cleverness.</p>

          <h3>Anemone</h3>
          <p><em>Anemone</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Forsaken love</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>The anemone’s association with forsaken love can be traced back to Greek mythology.
            The
            flower is said to have sprung from Aphrodite’s tears as she mourned the loss of her beloved Adonis. He was
            killed by the jealous gods over his relationship with the goddess of love.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Camellia to show longing for what could have been; Yarrow to help heal a broken
            heart.</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>

          <h3>Apple Blossom</h3>
          <p><em>Malus</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Preference</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>The apple’s connection to preference comes from the fable of the Golden Apple of
            Discord.
            Eris, the goddess of discord, threw a golden apple into a wedding ceremony that she was not invited to attend.
            The apple was inscribed with “For the most beautiful,” and Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite all laid claim to it.
            Zeus
            tasked Paris of Troy with deciding between the three goddesses. He eventually chose Aphrodite after she
            promised
            him the love of the world’s most beautiful woman, Helen of Sparta. Because Helen was already married to King
            Menelaus, Paris’s preference ultimately caused the Trojan War.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Pansy to show the recipient you’re thinking of them; Zinnia for a gift for a
            best friend.</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>

          <h3>Asphodel</h3>
          <p><em>Asphodelus</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>My regrets follow you to the grave</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>In Greek mythology, asphodels grew in the underworld and were consumed by the dead.
            Homer’s Odyssey shaped the idea of asphodel as a flower of regret, referring to the Asphodel Meadows as a
            section of the underworld where neither good nor evil souls resided—a type of ghostly purgatory.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Cypress or marigold to indicate mourning and despair; Rosemary to indicate
            eternal
            remembrance.</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>

          <h3>Aster</h3>
          <p><em>Symphyotrichum</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Daintiness</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>The aster’s association with daintiness most likely comes from its appearance. The
            many
            long and slender petals delicately surround a bright, yellow center: a tiny masterpiece in a field of blooms.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Daisy for a gift for a young girl; Buttercup to compliment someone’s charming
            demeanor.</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>

          <h3>Azalea</h3>
          <p><em>Rhododendron</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Fragility; Temperance</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>The azalea is notoriously fragile and difficult to grow. The beautiful, tender
            blossoms only
            last for a short time before tumbling to the ground. Along with this, its shallow roots do not tolerate
            overwatering,
            hence its association with temperance.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Mint or snowdrop to console a fragile state of mind; Heather to show the
            recipient will
            be taken care of in their time of need.</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>

          <h3>Baby's Breath</h3>
          <p><em>Gypsophila</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Purity; Innocence</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>In the late nineteenth century, the Gysophila plant was dubbed
            “baby’s breath,” due to its lovely scent and small, delicate blooms. Similar in appearance to the intricate
            lace
            of a bridal veil, this flower is frequently used in wedding bouquets as well as in arrangements for new
            mothers.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Lily as a gift for new parents Queen Anne’s lace as a gift for a godparent, to
            thank
            them for protecting and caring for the child.</p>

          <h3>Basil</h3>
          <p><em>Ocimum</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>Hate</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>Basil’s association with hate comes from the Greeks, who believed the plant’s
            unfolding
            leaves to resemble the basilisk’s opening jaws. The Greeks also associated hatred with the basilisk’s glare,
            because this legendary serpent could kill with just one glance.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Lavender for betrayal; Oleander as a warning to someone you distrust</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>
          <img src="assets/basil.png" alt="Drawing of basil flower">
        </div>
        <div class="flower">
          <h3>Begonia</h3>
          <p><em>Begonia</em></p>
          <p><strong>Meaning: </strong>To repay a favor; A warning</p>
          <p><strong>Origin: </strong>To repay a favor, Charles Plumier, a seventeenth-century French botanist, named the
            begonia
            flower after Michel Bégon, a French politician and plant collector. The flower’s name, which contains the
            phrase
            “be gone,” may explain its use as a symbol of warning.</p>
          <p><strong>Pair with... </strong>Sweet pea as a gift for the host of a party; Oleander to emphasize caution in a
            new prospect.</p>
          <p><strong>Looks like...</strong></p>
