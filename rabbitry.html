        <p>Angie's Fun Farm is a small rabbitry located on the south side of Chicago, Illinois, and we currently
          breed Holland lops bunnies for show and pets. We strive to breed rabbits that conform to the ARBA Standard of
          Perfection
          and, most importantly, are gentle and cheerful.</p>
        <p> Our rabbitry raises our bunnies from birth. We give them plenty of social interaction with children and other
          pets,
          as well as plenty of love and attention. We treat all of the bunnies as a part of our family, and we hope that all
          rabbits
          we raise go to a pet home that will bring them so much joy and care.</p>
        <p>If you are interested in a bunny, please watch the video below to get a basic understanding of what it entails to
          be a rabbit owner:</p>
